# Undergraduate Heat Transfer Research
This repository contains the code from undergraduate research in  Dr. Navdeep Dhillon’s STEAM-I lab at California State University, Long Beach. 
I undertook the Electric Drop experiment and developed theoretical models via OpenCV analysis in Python.. Will continue to update as more are created!

In this folder lie the assigned figures, models, and code (no technical documentation yet, publishment is on its way).

| :------------ | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| 1 | Experimental Setup | ![Rsrch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84933358/218894447-2f46e6b6-3e5f-4d47-815b-218e66fdb139.png) | -Illustrates the experimental setup :- -Smooth polished stainless-steel substrate :- -Results displayed on bottom right |
| 2 | Optical Images of the Drop's Deformation at 0kV |![Figure_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84933358/209671797-3dd20644-07af-46bb-8b0c-d5cd48ff9a2a.png)| - Exhibits the optical images of the drop's deformation :- - Times of the water droplet impact are labeled accordingly |
| 3 | Optical Images of the Drop's Deformation at 8kV | ![Figure_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84933358/209712394-3df8b84e-bbaa-468e-9876-96c0e67cfed3.png) | - Like Figure 2, Figure 3 also displays a compiled figure of the water drops deformation :- - Note that the ScaleBar can be used to determine droplet size |
| 4 | Drop’s Bubble Formation and Evaporation Behavior | ![Figure_4mod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84933358/209712454-c885f1cc-53f9-4904-b0b0-350b8ade04aa.png) | Compares the drop’s bubble formation and evaporation behavior characteristics under: :- 1. No electric field :- to that of a :- 2. High electric field presence |
| 5 | Hypothesis for the Necking After Impact | ![Drop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84933358/218894668-c1c4f955-e808-4f23-8983-98b7428f5bcb.png) | - Schematic for the necking process after impact :- - Drawn in Inkscape |
| 6 | Forces acting on Droplet |![Figure 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84933358/210669065-7c92755e-d561-4115-aff3-722095af2e00.png) | - Displays forces acting on Droplet :- - Constructed in Python with Matplotlib |
