# Undergraduate Heat Transfer Research
This repository contains the code from undergraduate research in  Dr. Navdeep Dhillonâ€™s STEAM-I lab at California State University, Long Beach. 
I undertook the Electric Drop experiment and developed theoretical models via OpenCV analysis in Python.. Will continue to update as more are created!

In this folder lie the assigned figures, models, and code (no technical documentation yet, publishment is on its way).
